This app was made with :heart: by Ahmed Hossam and Yasien Essam. 

Two biomedical engineers with an entrepreneurial spirit and a burning desire to make cool stuff with NLP and generative models! 

The classification and generation tasks are done using [Cohere](https://cohere.ai), as this app is a submission to a 
hackathon hosted by [lablab.ai](https://lablab.ai). Thanks to both for the resources to build this cool app!
